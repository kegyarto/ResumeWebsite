# Security Analysis

Limited login fails attempted

Possible attack: an attacker will want to gain access to an account through brute force and dictionaries and steal an user’s account.
Prevention: when a user has been attempting to login for five times, the login page will show on screen that the user should attempt to login after a determined lapse of time. Furthermore, the system will send an email to verify if the user has been attempting many times to login.
 
Complex password combination

Possible attack: attackers can have access to dictionaries of most common passwords. Using brute force, an attacker can have access to users’ sensitive information.
Prevention: the system will require a password combination with upper and lower, special characters and numbers
 
Strong encryption

Possible attack: an attacker can monitor network traffic from a site and then intercept the communication. The attacker will have access to an account if it steals the cookie session. The attacker may be able to modify a user’s profile.  
      
Prevention: up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and keys are in place; use proper key management.
 
Monitoring and recording user’s major activities

Possible attack: attackers are not identified due to a weak motoring and logging system. An attacker may change a user’s profile, projects, or description.
Prevention: Have a clear and detailed format of logging and monitoring uses’ login and activities.
 
Cross-Site Scripting

Possible attack: there are exploitation frameworks that attackers can use to gain access to an user’s account session.
Prevention: use of angular Ahead of time compilation (AOT). AOT compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript files long before they are served to the client.
